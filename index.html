        <span class="post-date">Aug 29 2012</span>
        <p>I must admit that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching">pattern matching</a> is not really new to me. The first time I looked at haskell I was impressed by the idea a lot. It wasn&rsquo;t until late that I found about new languages on the JVM that support the same idiom.</p>

<p>For this to work properly - the language should know how to &ldquo;destruct&rdquo; an already constructed element. A simple example in haskell is if you have a list of elements and you want to capture the first element in a variable and the remaining part of the list in another variable. In that case you would write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>f (x:xs) =  -- do something with &quot;x&quot; as the head of the list and &quot;xs&quot; as the tail 
</code></pre>

<p>This is a definition of <strong>f</strong> as a function on one argument - if you then call the function with a list like <strong>[1, 2, 3]</strong> you will have a <strong>x = 1</strong> and <strong>xs = [2, 3]</strong> in the body of the function.</p>

<p>So given this knowledge today I started coding a python script at work. And I found myself trying this pattern in the python interactive shell - the result was that python supports this for lists at least:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = [1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [a, b] = p
&gt;&gt;&gt; a 
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>But continuing further I was given an error message:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [a, b] = p
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: too many values to unpack
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>So while this works for full pattern on lists it won&rsquo;t work if you provide less elements.</p>

<p>It is strange how exotic languages like haskell can open your mind for idioms that you can use in more &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; languages like python.</p>

        <p>Here is some tricky code in C++ that I was watching recently and decided to post here for future references. Sometime the usage of operator overloading in C++ amuses me so much. Apperently there is a way to implement properties that look the same as normal properties and behave almost the same. The only problem as always is that when you get a compile time error - the messages are pretty confusing if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. Enough said here is the code for that &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; feature.</p>

<h1 id="the-problem:b5b8f7c735d5199a55cec0fbd9235a49">The problem</h1>

<p>Ok so you are using Linux or other Unix(Solaris, *BSD) favors to deploy your systems. If so you are most probably using ssh to log in on those servers. So to login to some external machine you will have to type something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ssh 73.32.32.22 -l nikolavp
</code></pre>

<p>and then when prompt for password, enter it. <strong>scp</strong>, <strong>rsync</strong> and friends will require almost the same amount of work.
This is bad for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It requires you to know the IP address or the DNS name whatsoever instead of doing an alias for yourself</p></li>

<li><p>You will have to remember the username for that host</p></li>

<li><p>You will have to remember the password for that host</p></li>

<li><p>You will have to break your fingers to type that over and over again</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Well if you are like me you most probably don&rsquo;t want to type all that much just do your work. Here I will provide a setup that will save your world :)</p>

<h2 id="create-an-alias-for-the-host:b5b8f7c735d5199a55cec0fbd9235a49">Create an alias for the host</h2>

<p>SSH provides a convenient shortcuts for making internal aliases for the hosts. You can define a host alias for an IP address(or DNS resolvable name) and the username for that host. So to not use the password for our imaginary host from the example above, we have include the following in our <strong>~/.ssh/config</strong> file(create it if it doesn&rsquo;t exist)</p>

<pre><code>Host=foo
Hostname=72.32.32.22
User=nikolavp
</code></pre>

<h2 id="create-a-ssh-key:b5b8f7c735d5199a55cec0fbd9235a49">Create a ssh key</h2>

<p>You should forget about your password as authenticating method, it is far safer to use a key for that and some sort of cryptography like RSA. You can follow some guide from the internet on how to do that exactly. For example <a href="http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html">this one</a> seems pretty simple and straightforward. Except that there is a far better command now for the last two steps - its called <strong>ssh-copy-id</strong>. You can man it if you want to know what it does.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-a-keymanager:b5b8f7c735d5199a55cec0fbd9235a49">Setting up a keymanager</h2>

<p>To be able to unlock your key once on every session start you should be using a key manager. Likely most of the big desktop environments have done this for you - gnome has gnome-keyring and kde has the kde-wallet. On other more primitive environments you will be on your own. You can look at the guide from Archlinux for more information <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_Keys#ssh-agent">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts:b5b8f7c735d5199a55cec0fbd9235a49">Final thoughts</h1>

<p>After following the steps from this simple and short guide you should be able to log into your servers without any password with just it&rsquo;s alias. For our host from the example, I will just have to write</p>

<pre><code>ssh foo
</code></pre>
