        <span class="post-date">Sep 18 2008</span>
        <p>Yesterday I wanted to integrate <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> tasks from the <a href="http://trac.assembla.com/kbgoffice/report/1">kbgoffice</a> task list in my IDE. I was sure that eclipse should have that feature so I search in <a href="http://google.com/">google</a> and found that indeed there is a connector for Trac in mylyn-extras. Well i wanted to find an update site for that but it seems there isn&rsquo;t any. So i downloaded the the extras version from the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/downloads/">main download page</a> and installed it locally.</p>

<p>It seems that eclipse is getting really mature since last time i did that i had bad problems with dependencies not resolved and things like that. Now it included the package as just another update site source, so the package manager can resolve dependencies if any.</p>

<p>All in all the plugin is not really what i was hoping for. I had some tasks from mylyn throughout the project and wanted to synchronize those but i couldn&rsquo;t. Also the trac tasks when opened just open a browser which is not really what i was hoping for(i wanted to get a nice view which should look like a normal mylyn task). It is better than opening an external browser and searching for the task you want though, but not the best and i hope they fix it for the next release.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sep 1 2008</span>
        <p>Hmm today on IRC in the channel ##C++ @ Freenode someone posted the following code</p>

<pre><code>/*In g++ this does not work*/
template
struct hello
{
 hello(){};
 ~hello(){};
 template
 int world()
 {
  return _b+_a;
 }
};
</code></pre>

<p>template
void try_hello()
{
hello h;
h.world();
}</p>

<p>so i tried to help the person telling him that he should use a typename before h.world(); because it can ambitious for the compiler. It turns out that the right solution was</p>

<pre><code>h.typename world();
</code></pre>

<p>someone asked why is</p>

<pre><code>world()
</code></pre>

<p>ambitious for the compiler and seldon said that the compiler can&rsquo;t know the type of world in that context. Well but world is explicitly called with</p>

<p>. Hmm the problem is that when the compiler see that expression it assume that</p>

<pre><code>&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>after world is the operator less than. Oh that my brain started to hurt badly :D. Maybe the syntax of C++ is getting really complicated with the years. I think that the new standards won&rsquo;t get rid of those, because they can&rsquo;t. Too much code have been written already to work that way :(</p>

        <span class="post-date">Aug 30 2008</span>
        <p>Hmm yesterday i finally came back from the vacation in the mountain. I prefer it instead of the sea, because the sea is too dirty in the last years. As you maybe know i live in Bulgaria and it is near the Black sea which is pretty much aweful. Most of the time i was fishing swimming in a nice Pool near <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100789870492295989353.000455aa4b7201cd48d24&amp;z=17">Ribarica</a>. I also almost read Code complete second edition which is pretty old book but is still adequate for most of the tips. The author is one of those writers which make you think about every single word without making you bored of the book ;). It is language independent - there are examples in VB(which i don&rsquo;t know but you can understand the idea of the examples with no problem), C#, Java, C++, C. One thing is for sure - the mountain was damn better than the dirty sea :).</p>
