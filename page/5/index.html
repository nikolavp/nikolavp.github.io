        <span class="post-date">May 4 2009</span>
        <p>Today almost the half an hour I was trying to write that algorithm which multiplies two sparse matrix. At the end this is what I&rsquo;ve got. The matrix is represented as a linkedlist of triples, because this is how they want it in our university. There were some mistakes in the code like Sparce is not with &ldquo;s&rdquo;, but those are pretty much syntax mistakes and i didn&rsquo;t want to make changes for our teacher :).</p>

<pre><code>public NumericMatrix multWith(SparseMatrix mat) throws CannotMult, 
   OutOfMatrixRange {
   if (!canMult(mat)){
       throw new CannotMult();
   }
   SparseMatrix result = new SparseMatrix(this.rows, mat.columns);
   if (body.isEmpty() || mat.body.isEmpty()){
       return result;
   }
   Iterator&lt;triple&gt; itForThis = this.body.iterator();

   while (itForThis.hasNext()) {
       Triple thisElement = itForThis.next();
       Iterator&lt;triple&gt; itForMat = mat.body.iterator();
       while (itForMat.hasNext()) {
           Triple thatElement = itForMat.next();
           if (thatElement.i &gt; thisElement.j){
               break;
           }
           if (thisElement.j == thatElement.i) {
               double value = result.elementAt(thisElement.i,
                       thatElement.j);
               result.setElement(thisElement.i, thatElement.j, value
                       + thisElement.element * thatElement.element);
           }
       }
   }
   return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry for the bad code formatting but java is kind of verbose :(. All in all the code is not so nice but it was the only thing that came up and worked so I am posting it here if someone need it, because there wasn&rsquo;t good simple code for that algorithm. I didn&rsquo;t have the time to look at performance libraries and how they implement that, but I read some interesting stuff on wikipedia.com. I didn&rsquo;t know that there was an algorthm that can multiply two Ordinary matrices in O(n^2.376). Take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%E2%80%93Winograd_algorithm">page</a>. If you find some free materials about the algorithm please let me know I will be glad to look into it, because I might need it for some graphic stuff I will be doing next year :)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Fixed some stuff and chan the name to SparseMatrix to be really normal :)</p>

        <span class="post-date">May 4 2009</span>
        <p>This is the first time i write from ScribeFire - my new choice for blog editor. I tried almost every client out there for Linux(since i am using kubuntu) and they were all buggy for me. For example</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I didn&rsquo;t manage to configure <a href="http://kblogger.pwsp.net/">kblogger-kde4</a> - the damn thing couldn&rsquo;t find my posts and entries</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://kblogger.pwsp.net/">Blogtk</a> didn&rsquo;t even start - it wanted gtkhtml2 which python couldn&rsquo;t find and after I installed it I got a ValueError in a property named &ldquo;name&rdquo; and I was too tired to look at the code.</p></li>

<li><p>Divel - which I didn&rsquo;t like at all :)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>     I just installed ScribeFire and i didn&rsquo;t have a problem with it and I also like the interface it has mostly anything. It seems that the browser will really become my desktop in a year or two. I am not sure why, but the homepage is not working for ScribeFire. Fortunately i managed to configure the plugin and it is working really nice. The interface is pretty slick and the I can see the KISS principle everywhere :).</p>

        <span class="post-date">Apr 21 2009</span>
        <p>Yesterday while I was again searching for nice tools and plugins for eclipse which is what I use for my day to day programming now, I found that there is a new project that want to provide vim like input scheme in eclipse. I was pretty skeptical at first because I have already tried</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://eclim.sourceforge.net/">Eclim</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://vimplugin.org/">Vimplugin</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>and wasn&rsquo;t happy from the results at all. Eclim is not bad in the last release but it is trying to make vim a full blown IDE monster which is not what I want. I just want to edit my files with the keystrokes that I am used to, but the problem is that I am now used to some of the eclipse keystrokes - +o , +m and +f come to my mind. If you are like me then you are lucky - enter <a href="http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/">Vrapper</a>. The project is pretty new, but it does just what I want. Macros and find/replaces are missing for now(you can invoke the latter with +f in eclipse) but all in all most of the stuff is working fine like:</p>

<pre><code>* the **h**, **j**, **k**, **l** moving keys


* **cw**, **dw**, **A**, **dd** and **cc**


* **u** and **+r**
</code></pre>

<p>so if you are a long time vim user and you are trying to get used to eclipse or you are using it for something try the plugin. In my opinion it is the best solution out there.</p>
