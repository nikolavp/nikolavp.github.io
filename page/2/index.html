        <span class="post-date">Mar 14 2012</span>
        <p>Today I got this error message from skype in Linux while I was trying to login. After many attempts to get rid of the message by restarting skype, I finally googled the message and found out that there are two .lck files that need to be deleted. But after trying it and restarting it again, this didn&rsquo;t solve it. If you happen to be one of those unlucky &ldquo;souls&rdquo;. Do the following:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.Skype/
find -name '*.lck' -exec rm {} +
mv ${old_profile} ${old_profile}.back
</code></pre>

<p>This deletes all .lck files and makes a backup of your login history data, assuming ${old_profile} is the name of your skype login name.</p>

<p>Now open skype, login in with your account, quit skype and then to restore the history do:</p>

<pre><code>rsync -av ${old_profile}.old/ ${old_profile}/
</code></pre>

<h1 id="the-why:70edf2da10fd3f3284909ed33498cf7c">The why</h1>

<p>You are currently reading this post on my new blog, built on top of <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">OpenShift</a>. My blog was on the blogger platform in the past, but i finally decided to move from there for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>small screen/content width</strong> - this was the main reason that made me move. The width of the box content is so small that it&rsquo;s really hard to post a snippet of code. When I struggled half an hour with the templates just to make them wider and I couldn&rsquo;t, I just gave up&hellip; Which leads us to the next point</p></li>

<li><p><strong>more control</strong> - I was feeling the blogging platform pretty limited for some things. I can remember spending 3 hours once just to make the damn code snippets work and highlight as I wanted them to be</p></li>

<li><p><strong>not mine</strong> - the platform is pretty nice, but was always feeling the site is not really mine.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am not really a fan of PHP, actually it&rsquo;s the only language that I don&rsquo;t like <strong>at all</strong>, but wordpress seems like the best option out there for blogging. Everything seems to be simple and at the end of the day nothings stops me to get my hands dirty and edit some code, which btw is <strong>really</strong> readable. It&rsquo;s just not like other PHP code I have dealt with.</p>

<h1 id="step-by-step-guide:70edf2da10fd3f3284909ed33498cf7c">Step by step guide</h1>

<p>So here is a step by step guide to the migration process.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-blogging-openshift-application:70edf2da10fd3f3284909ed33498cf7c">Create a blogging openshift application</h2>

<p>This assumes that you have the openshift rhc client and stuff installed. So here we go&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>create the application, named blog in my case(this assumes you have a domain already)</p>

<p>rhc-create-app -a blog -t php-5.3</p></li>

<li><p>create a mysql instance</p>

<p>rhc-ctl-app -a blog -e add-mysql-5.1</p></li>
</ol>

<p>this will output some information about your current database name, user, password, url</p>

<h2 id="install-wordpress:70edf2da10fd3f3284909ed33498cf7c">Install wordpress</h2>

<p>First we download the wordpress distribution</p>

<pre><code>cd blog
wget -c http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar zxvf latest.tar.gz
mv wordpress/* php
</code></pre>

<p>Push the code to openshift</p>

<pre><code>git add php
git commit -m 'Initial wordpress commit'
git push origin
</code></pre>

<p>wordpress should be now deployed on the server. Now</p>

<ol>
<li><p>go to <em><a href="http://appname-domain-name.rhcloud.com/wp-admin/setup-config.php">http://appname-domain-name.rhcloud.com/wp-admin/setup-config.php</a></em> to setup the database information then</p></li>

<li><p>go to <em><a href="http://appname-domain-name.rhcloud.com/wp-admin/install.php">http://appname-domain-name.rhcloud.com/wp-admin/install.php</a></em> to setup the tables, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that <strong>appname</strong> should be application name that we created in step 1 in openshift and the <strong>domain-name</strong> is your domain on openshift. That&rsquo;s it, you now should have your wordpress ready to go. With this you are able to install plugins, create custom pages, etc, etc.</p>

<h2 id="setup-redirection:70edf2da10fd3f3284909ed33498cf7c">Setup redirection</h2>

<p>There is only one last step until we are finally done. We want to notify our users somehow that the blog has moved.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go in blogger to <strong>Settings -&gt; Publishing</strong> and specify the new domain for your blog there.</p></li>

<li><p>Go in wordpress to <strong>Settings -&gt; Permalinks</strong>, set the custom structure radio button and type</p>

<p>/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%.html</p></li>
</ol>

<p>there. This will make sure that links to post from the old blog go to the new blog content.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a new post telling your users that you moved. This is only for feed purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will be glad if someone finds this guide helpful.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://nikolavp.github.io/blog/2011/09/28/moved-from-ubuntu-to-arch/">Moved from Ubuntu to Arch</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Sep 28 2011</span>
        <p><strong>Intro</strong></p>

<p>After 3 years with Ubuntu on my laptop <a href="http://www.lapwik.com/hp-compaq_6730s">HP 6730s</a>, I finally decided to switch to something faster and more reliable(I will talk about this some more)</p>

<p>Some history:
I was an old Gentoo user before and I was using it on my desktop machine. After I got my laptop though I knew that Gentoo is not so suitable for laptops(the compilation is killing them) so Ubuntu seemed like a nice choice. Something that just works out of the box is so important for laptops - i.e. I don&rsquo;t want to configure my wireless for hours.</p>

<p><strong>The problems I had with Ubuntu:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>It tries to hide the system from me. This really annoys me - I want to be able to configure my system by hand sometimes and don&rsquo;t want to find out that some service that I don&rsquo;t know about, started by Ubuntu, is autoediting my config files every now and then :(</p></li>

<li><p>The performance is bad - as I am mostly working with java applications and I feel them slow. I am not sure who is to blame for this but the other computers I have deployed on are working better.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s not using a rolling release model which makes me pray and fix my machine every new release.</p></li>

<li><p>Some packages are old because of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; release model.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So after the latest problems which I had with NetworkManager i finally decided to switch to something better. I couldn&rsquo;t find why, but my machine was booting like 2 minutes and messages poped up, telling me it&rsquo;s because of the network manager.</p>

<p>So far Arch seems stable, far faster(you cannot imagine), boots in 30 seconds with all services up. It just feels right.</p>
