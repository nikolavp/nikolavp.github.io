      <description>Today almost the half an hour I was trying to write that algorithm which multiplies two sparse matrix. At the end this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve got. The matrix is represented as a linkedlist of triples, because this is how they want it in our university. There were some mistakes in the code like Sparce is not with &amp;ldquo;s&amp;rdquo;, but those are pretty much syntax mistakes and i didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make changes for our teacher :).</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wanted to integrate Trac tasks from the kbgoffice task list in my IDE. I was sure that eclipse should have that feature so I search in google and found that indeed there is a connector for Trac in mylyn-extras. Well i wanted to find an update site for that but it seems there isn&amp;rsquo;t any. So i downloaded the the extras version from the main download page and installed it locally.</description>

      <description>Hmm lately I started using eclipse more and more. It seems they made it to not crash so much with the new release. I am pretty happy with it for C++ development it seems to own. I am not sure but i think that I am even more productive with it now than with vim. I have used the 3.2 version but it was full crap back then ;). Besides it is written in java it is worth looking in it.</description>
