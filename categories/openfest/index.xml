      <description>Yesterday I promised that I will be blogging about OpenFest2008, because I was too tired back then.
All in all the event was pretty nice organized, there were free drinks like beer(I enjoyed it many times :P ), coffee, tea. I really liked some of the lectures like the one about scalability from yesterday. The lecture about wordpress was nice and I learned many things from it like what is available when you are building a site with that size and what are the right decisions.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty late here. I just entered my room, because I was at the OpenFest today and after that I met some friends. Look forward to read about the OpenFest tomorrow, because I am too tired to write the whole story and I actually don&amp;rsquo;t have the time. Tomorrow there are lectures in FMI and Diskrete Math is too important to be missed.</description>
