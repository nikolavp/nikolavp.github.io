      Here is some tricky code in C++ that I was watching recently and decided to post here for future references. Sometime the usage of operator overloading in C++ amuses me so much. Apperently there is a way to implement properties that look the same as normal properties and behave almost the same. The only problem as always is that when you get a compile time error - the messages are pretty confusing if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.

      Maybe some of you know that kubuntu/ubuntu is providing 32 bit flash player and is using nspluginwrapper if you are using an 64 OS. Here the nspluginwrapper is making problems, it is making my machine unresponsible if I am watching 3 flash sites at the time and so on. I am also suspecting that it is the reason firefox crashes sometimes on some flash movies.
So here is the workarround. On the official website of adobe there is no 64 option so we have to dig a little more.

      Yesterday i finally managed to port kbgoffice completely to Qt4, so everyone with no qt3support can compile it. I am not happy with what i got however. The code is really bad and there are no testcases so i might write those for now. With no tests the development is really hard. I might use the test framework provided with Qt which really rocks. The program is also hard coded with a class named Properties which is really broken, because it seems that when they wrote the program there was no QSettings class which is times better :).

      I recently read This blog post and the author has a nice point about garbage collectors. When we program in languages with that feature we should not blindly trust the automatic memory management for everything. Most of the time it is ok, but sometimes you have to think about memory management in those languages too. In the blog post Tahseen Ur Rehman gives an example with a thread which was holding some references to the objects so they could not be deleted, so the users were getting OutOfMemoryErrors.

      Some of you may be missing the nice IDE&rsquo;s and their neat features when you are editing in gvim. I was myself a long time Eclipse user, but I found that it doesn&rsquo;t make me more productive, but just eat the resources of my machine. I missed the renaming variable feature in gvim for some time now. Today this is over I was reading the manual of vim and found what I was looking for.

      Here is some tricky code in C++ that I was watching recently and decided to post here for future references. Sometime the usage of operator overloading in C++ amuses me so much. Apperently there is a way to implement properties that look the same as normal properties and behave almost the same. The only problem as always is that when you get a compile time error - the messages are pretty confusing if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.

      Yesterday i finally managed to port kbgoffice completely to Qt4, so everyone with no qt3support can compile it. I am not happy with what i got however. The code is really bad and there are no testcases so i might write those for now. With no tests the development is really hard. I might use the test framework provided with Qt which really rocks. The program is also hard coded with a class named Properties which is really broken, because it seems that when they wrote the program there was no QSettings class which is times better :).

      Maybe you know that vim parses the output from the compiler so it can jump to the right line which cause the error(:h quickfix for more info). Well it seems that the default compiler options parse even warning which are sometimes pretty annoying. There were some warning for depracated conversion from the compiler because of xmp files.

After 3 years with Ubuntu on my laptop HP 6730s, I finally decided to switch to something faster and more reliable(I will talk about this some more)
Some history: I was an old Gentoo user before and I was using it on my desktop machine. After I got my laptop though I knew that Gentoo is not so suitable for laptops(the compilation is killing them) so Ubuntu seemed like a nice choice.

      I have a new laptop HP Compaq 6730s. It seems that the drivers from the official kubuntu repository are not working :(. After I installed xorg-driver-fglrx and wanted to restart X - it locked. So I had to revert the xorg.conf from safe mode. Today I had the time and tried again with the official binaries from ATI and for now they seem to work really well. I enjoy the desktop effects from time to time and I can finally watch video with a mode different from sdl :).

      Have you already used twine, if not check it out. It is like a social bookmarking system and i am using it lately extensively for getting the latest information about the semantic technologies and the next generation web 3.0. After using it for about a week or two it starts to &ldquo;know you&rdquo; and recommend useful information based on your interest.
For example today i got this video with &ldquo;Did you know&rdquo; stuff which is mostly mentioning things about the internet but there are some nice facts about the population in USA, India.

The problem with the dynamically loading external jars is that they should not be in the CLASSPATH because the system classloader is making some optimizations(cache) of the currently loaded classes and doesn&rsquo;t search again in the CLASSPATH if it has already instantiated the class.

      I recently read This blog post and the author has a nice point about garbage collectors. When we program in languages with that feature we should not blindly trust the automatic memory management for everything. Most of the time it is ok, but sometimes you have to think about memory management in those languages too. In the blog post Tahseen Ur Rehman gives an example with a thread which was holding some references to the objects so they could not be deleted, so the users were getting OutOfMemoryErrors.

      Today i just wanted to make a benchmark and see which is faster java or C++. There are rumors over the internet that java is or will be faster than c++ some day. So today I decided to try compare the speed of those languages. We all know arrays and how bad they can be sometimes if you are not careful with them in C++, because
* They don't know it's size You cannot extend it if you reach the limit

      It&rsquo;s pretty late here. I just entered my room, because I was at the OpenFest today and after that I met some friends. Look forward to read about the OpenFest tomorrow, because I am too tired to write the whole story and I actually don&rsquo;t have the time. Tomorrow there are lectures in FMI and Diskrete Math is too important to be missed.

      The code for kbgoffice is working already on my machine. It is not really ported to Qt4, because right now it relays on the qt3support which will not be there and for good ;). There are also some annoying bugs(I will see where they came from, so keep calm :P). The instructions to compile the code(notice there is no target to install it for now) are in the INSTALL file. To get the code you will need subversion.

      Maybe some of you like me like to use a sophisticated library for C++ development. My choice is Qt. I really like to have highlighting for most of the classes so here is my ~/.vim/syntax/cpp.vim. This will highlight all of the Qt classes as built in structures of the language, which is really nice. I just copied all of the classes from the Qt&rsquo;s web site ;).
UPDATE: Today Vidas Katinas send me the modified version so i have updated the link.

      If you are like me, most of the time you make more mistakes in vim, because your mind is little slower than you fingers. Enter abbreviations which is a really neat feature in vim :). You just have to type
:iabbrev wrongstring wantedstring in command mode and the next time you type the word wrong vim will fix it. So where is the problem? The problem is that when you type that in command mode it is not persistent between sessions.

      Some of you may be missing the nice IDE&rsquo;s and their neat features when you are editing in gvim. I was myself a long time Eclipse user, but I found that it doesn&rsquo;t make me more productive, but just eat the resources of my machine. I missed the renaming variable feature in gvim for some time now. Today this is over I was reading the manual of vim and found what I was looking for.

      Today, while I was using the KDE 4.1 I noticed that is a bit slower than it was before with 3.5. So after a little searching(one query in gogle) on the net I found this page which just saved my day. I can now say that KDE is faster than ever it was. I can&rsquo;t believe they managed to make the damn thing even faster :). Nice work guys, keep it up!
