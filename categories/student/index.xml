      <description>This is the first time i write from ScribeFire - my new choice for blog editor. I tried almost every client out there for Linux(since i am using kubuntu) and they were all buggy for me. For example
I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to configure kblogger-kde4 - the damn thing couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my posts and entries
Blogtk didn&amp;rsquo;t even start - it wanted gtkhtml2 which python couldn&amp;rsquo;t find and after I installed it I got a ValueError in a property named &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; and I was too tired to look at the code.</description>

      <description>Sorry that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing lately but I am now living in Student city and there a don&amp;rsquo;t have a computer with Internet connection. I will bring my laptop maybe this week so I will finally have one. The first week was not so bad - I had lectures on Algebra and Discrete mathematics. All in all I think that I will be &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; with those, but we will see what the time will show.</description>
