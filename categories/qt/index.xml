      <description>Yesterday i finally managed to port kbgoffice completely to Qt4, so everyone with no qt3support can compile it. I am not happy with what i got however. The code is really bad and there are no testcases so i might write those for now. With no tests the development is really hard. I might use the test framework provided with Qt which really rocks. The program is also hard coded with a class named Properties which is really broken, because it seems that when they wrote the program there was no QSettings class which is times better :).</description>

      <description>Maybe some of you like me like to use a sophisticated library for C++ development. My choice is Qt. I really like to have highlighting for most of the classes so here is my ~/.vim/syntax/cpp.vim. This will highlight all of the Qt classes as built in structures of the language, which is really nice. I just copied all of the classes from the Qt&amp;rsquo;s web site ;).
UPDATE: Today Vidas Katinas send me the modified version so i have updated the link.</description>
