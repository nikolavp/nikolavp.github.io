      <description>Hmm yesterday i finally came back from the vacation in the mountain. I prefer it instead of the sea, because the sea is too dirty in the last years. As you maybe know i live in Bulgaria and it is near the Black sea which is pretty much aweful. Most of the time i was fishing swimming in a nice Pool near Ribarica. I also almost read Code complete second edition which is pretty old book but is still adequate for most of the tips.</description>
