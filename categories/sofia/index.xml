      <description>This is the first time i write from ScribeFire - my new choice for blog editor. I tried almost every client out there for Linux(since i am using kubuntu) and they were all buggy for me. For example
I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to configure kblogger-kde4 - the damn thing couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my posts and entries
Blogtk didn&amp;rsquo;t even start - it wanted gtkhtml2 which python couldn&amp;rsquo;t find and after I installed it I got a ValueError in a property named &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; and I was too tired to look at the code.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I promised that I will be blogging about OpenFest2008, because I was too tired back then.
All in all the event was pretty nice organized, there were free drinks like beer(I enjoyed it many times :P ), coffee, tea. I really liked some of the lectures like the one about scalability from yesterday. The lecture about wordpress was nice and I learned many things from it like what is available when you are building a site with that size and what are the right decisions.</description>
