      I must admit that pattern matching is not really new to me. The first time I looked at haskell I was impressed by the idea a lot. It wasn&rsquo;t until late that I found about new languages on the JVM that support the same idiom.
For this to work properly - the language should know how to &ldquo;destruct&rdquo; an already constructed element. A simple example in haskell is if you have a list of elements and you want to capture the first element in a variable and the remaining part of the list in another variable.

      Here is some tricky code in C++ that I was watching recently and decided to post here for future references. Sometime the usage of operator overloading in C++ amuses me so much. Apperently there is a way to implement properties that look the same as normal properties and behave almost the same. The only problem as always is that when you get a compile time error - the messages are pretty confusing if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.

      Maybe some of you know that kubuntu/ubuntu is providing 32 bit flash player and is using nspluginwrapper if you are using an 64 OS. Here the nspluginwrapper is making problems, it is making my machine unresponsible if I am watching 3 flash sites at the time and so on. I am also suspecting that it is the reason firefox crashes sometimes on some flash movies.
So here is the workarround. On the official website of adobe there is no 64 option so we have to dig a little more.

      I haven&rsquo;t blogged in a while but now i have some time :). This week I had to dynamically reload some jars from a directory and i searched the net about the problem. I will show the implementation that I finally came up with. The problem with the dynamically loading external jars is that they should not be in the CLASSPATH because the system classloader is making some optimizations(cache) of the currently loaded classes and doesn&rsquo;t search again in the CLASSPATH if it has already instantiated the class.

The code is really bad and there are no testcases so i might write those for now. With no tests the development is really hard. I might use the test framework provided with Qt which really rocks. The program is also hard coded with a class named Properties which is really broken, because it seems that when they wrote the program there was no QSettings class which is times better :).

When we program in languages with that feature we should not blindly trust the automatic memory management for everything. Most of the time it is ok, but sometimes you have to think about memory management in those languages too. In the blog post Tahseen Ur Rehman gives an example with a thread which was holding some references to the objects so they could not be deleted, so the users were getting OutOfMemoryErrors.
