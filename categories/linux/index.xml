      <description>Intro
After 3 years with Ubuntu on my laptop HP 6730s, I finally decided to switch to something faster and more reliable(I will talk about this some more)
Some history: I was an old Gentoo user before and I was using it on my desktop machine. After I got my laptop though I knew that Gentoo is not so suitable for laptops(the compilation is killing them) so Ubuntu seemed like a nice choice.</description>

      <description>I have a new laptop HP Compaq 6730s. It seems that the drivers from the official kubuntu repository are not working :(. After I installed xorg-driver-fglrx and wanted to restart X - it locked. So I had to revert the xorg.conf from safe mode. Today I had the time and tried again with the official binaries from ATI and for now they seem to work really well. I enjoy the desktop effects from time to time and I can finally watch video with a mode different from sdl :).</description>

      <description>This is the first time i write from ScribeFire - my new choice for blog editor. I tried almost every client out there for Linux(since i am using kubuntu) and they were all buggy for me. For example
I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to configure kblogger-kde4 - the damn thing couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my posts and entries
Blogtk didn&amp;rsquo;t even start - it wanted gtkhtml2 which python couldn&amp;rsquo;t find and after I installed it I got a ValueError in a property named &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; and I was too tired to look at the code.</description>
