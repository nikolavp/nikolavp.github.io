<p>     I just installed ScribeFire and i didn&rsquo;t have a problem with it and I also like the interface it has mostly anything. It seems that the browser will really become my desktop in a year or two. I am not sure why, but the homepage is not working for ScribeFire. Fortunately i managed to configure the plugin and it is working really nice. The interface is pretty slick and the I can see the KISS principle everywhere :).</p>
