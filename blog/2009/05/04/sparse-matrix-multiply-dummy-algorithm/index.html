<p>Sorry for the bad code formatting but java is kind of verbose :(. All in all the code is not so nice but it was the only thing that came up and worked so I am posting it here if someone need it, because there wasn&rsquo;t good simple code for that algorithm. I didn&rsquo;t have the time to look at performance libraries and how they implement that, but I read some interesting stuff on wikipedia.com. I didn&rsquo;t know that there was an algorthm that can multiply two Ordinary matrices in O(n^2.376). Take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%E2%80%93Winograd_algorithm">page</a>. If you find some free materials about the algorithm please let me know I will be glad to look into it, because I might need it for some graphic stuff I will be doing next year :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Fixed some stuff and chan the name to SparseMatrix to be really normal :)</p>
