<p>For example today i got <a href="http://www.penn-olson.com/2009/08/26/technology-social-wows-all-in-one-video/">this video</a> with &ldquo;<strong>Did you know</strong>&rdquo; stuff which is mostly mentioning things about the internet but there are some nice facts about the population in <strong>USA, India</strong>. It is really interesting i think :).</p>
<p>Check <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J132shgIiuY">this video</a> also which was in the web 3.0 twine section of mine. This is Kevin Kelly and he is talking about web 3.0 and how he sees the WWW 20 years from now. It is a must see :)</p>
