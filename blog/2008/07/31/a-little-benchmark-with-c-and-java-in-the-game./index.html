    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Today i just wanted to make a benchmark and see which is faster java or C++. There are rumors over the internet that java is or will be faster than c++ some day. So today I decided to try compare the speed of those languages. We all know arrays and how bad they can be sometimes if you are not careful with them in C++, because</p>
<pre><code>* They don't know it's size
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You cannot extend it if you reach the limit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of an array converts to a pointer to its first element at the slightest provocation(there are nice examples for this point <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/bs_faq2.html#arrays">here</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So with one word arrays are not nice. Java provides some fixes for those, because there an array know it&rsquo;s size and there are no pointers :). But what if we use a higher level abstractions from STL? Will std::vector beat the Java arrays? Here is the code:
main.cpp:</p>
<p>#include <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>#include <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]){</p>
<p>std::vector<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Vec(10000);</p>
<p>for(int x = 0;x &lt; Vec.size();x++){</p>
<p>Vec[x] =x;</p>
<p>std::cout &laquo; Vec[x] &laquo; std::endl;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Main.java</p>
<p>class Main{</p>
<p>public static void main(String []args){</p>
<p>int Vec[] = new int[10000];</p>
<p>for (int x = 0;x &lt; Vec.length;x++){</p>
<p>Vec[x] = x;</p>
<p>System.out.println(x);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>So we compile with</p>
<pre><code>g++ -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer main.cpp &amp;&amp; javac Main.java
</code></pre>
<p>and let&rsquo;s run them through time :)</p>
<pre><code>nikolavp@Nikolavp:~$ time ./a.out &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.010suser    0m0.004ssys     0m0.004snikolavp@Nikolavp:~$ time java Main &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.196suser    0m0.140ssys     0m0.052s
</code></pre>
<p>So C++ with vector which is supposed to be a higher level abbstraction outperformed Java&rsquo;s &ldquo;safe&rdquo; arrays. The next time you want to write something in Java think a little bit is it really worth the machines ;). Don&rsquo;t get me wrong Java have it&rsquo;s place and it made the whole world a better place, but don&rsquo;t convince me, that it will be faster(or is faster now) than C++&hellip; It just never will.</p>
<p><code>#include using namespace std; int main(){ }</code>
<code>for(var i=0;i{ go(&quot;http://orkut.com&quot;) enter(&quot;Email&quot;,&quot;myemail@gmail.com&quot;) enter(&quot;password&quot;,&quot;secret&quot;) sleep(600) click(&quot;sign in&quot;) sleep(600) go(&quot;http://www.orkut.com/GLogin.aspx?cmd=logout&quot;) sleep(60) }</code></p>
<ul class="pa0">
