I was myself a long time Eclipse user, but I found that it doesn&rsquo;t make me more productive, but just eat the resources of my machine. I missed the renaming variable feature in gvim for some time now. Today this is over I was reading the manual of vim and found what I was looking for. We all know the substitute command, but I was not sure how to replace the variable with one command for all files in the project. So here is what I have now in my .vimrc:</p>
<pre><code>fun! BuffersRenameVar(cword, newvar)        let word = a:cword        let newvar = a:newvar        let replace = &quot;:bufdo %s/\\\
</code></pre>
<p>You just hit \brn for buffer rename and have to change the &ldquo;nvname&rdquo;
with the new name of the variable and that&rsquo;s all :). This will ask you
to rename every appearance of the variable in all open buffers. Don&rsquo;t
forget to open all all your files in vim. This will also put a global
mark named &ldquo;R&rdquo; so you can continue your work. Happy vimming</p>
