This year there will be again an <a href="http://www.openfest.org">Openfest</a> here in Bulgaria. I hope, that I won&rsquo;t miss it this time. Last year I couldn&rsquo;t visit the fest and there weren&rsquo;t any uploaded videos out there in the net. I can see that the site is now updated so i will watch the uploaded videos when i have time. This week is full of nice events. First there is a new course in TU sofia which will describe the philosophy of Open source - more information <a href="http://www.fosscourse.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0">here</a>. Next there will be two nice lectures in our faculty:</p>
