There are also some annoying bugs(I will see where they came from, so keep calm :P). The instructions to compile the code(notice there is no target to install it for now) are in the INSTALL file. To get the code you will need subversion. Search google if you don&rsquo;t know how to get it. The command to checkout the code is</p>
<pre><code>svn co http://svn.assembla.com/svn/kbgoffice/trunk kbgoffice;cd kbgoffice
</code></pre>
<p>now</p>
<pre><code>cat INSTALL
</code></pre>
<p>and follow the instructions. You will also need the dictionary files which you can find over <a href="http://bgoffice.sourceforge.net/">here</a></p>
