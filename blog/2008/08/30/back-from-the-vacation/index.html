I also almost read Code complete second edition which is pretty old book but is still adequate for most of the tips. The author is one of those writers which make you think about every single word without making you bored of the book ;). It is language independent - there are examples in VB(which i don&rsquo;t know but you can understand the idea of the examples with no problem), C#, Java, C++, C. One thing is for sure - the mountain was damn better than the dirty sea :).</p>
