<p>It had to <strong>list</strong> the files in a directories of my project</p>

<p>I wanted to be able to open the files from there to the right side of the window as antoher buffer/tab</p>

<p>There are many plugins out there that solve some of the problems/requirements in the list, but they were not complete. I have tried project(this one was good), the built in explorer, some other explorers, which names i cannot remember :D.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">NERDTree</a>. That is one of the plugins that saves your day. I just put</p>
<pre><code>map &lt;F6&gt; :NERDTreeToggle
</code></pre>
<p>in my vimrc and now when i hit F6 i have a list of the files in my home directory. I go to that window with either the mouse or <!-- raw HTML omitted --> w and now i can use the neat features of the plugin.</p>
<pre><code>? - get helpC - make the directory your ROOTo - open/close the directory(this shows the files also in the     directory as a list
</code></pre>
<p>When you finish don&rsquo;t forget to hit F6 again :D</p>
