<p>After 3 years with Ubuntu on my laptop <a href="http://www.lapwik.com/hp-compaq_6730s">HP 6730s</a>, I finally decided to switch to something faster and more reliable(I will talk about this some more)</p>
<p>Some history:
I was an old Gentoo user before and I was using it on my desktop machine. After I got my laptop though I knew that Gentoo is not so suitable for laptops(the compilation is killing them) so Ubuntu seemed like a nice choice. Something that just works out of the box is so important for laptops - i.e. I don&rsquo;t want to configure my wireless for hours.</p>
<p><strong>The problems I had with Ubuntu:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It tries to hide the system from me. This really annoys me - I want to be able to configure my system by hand sometimes and don&rsquo;t want to find out that some service that I don&rsquo;t know about, started by Ubuntu, is autoediting my config files every now and then :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance is bad - as I am mostly working with java applications and I feel them slow. I am not sure who is to blame for this but the other computers I have deployed on are working better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not using a rolling release model which makes me pray and fix my machine every new release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some packages are old because of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; release model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So after the latest problems which I had with NetworkManager i finally decided to switch to something better. I couldn&rsquo;t find why, but my machine was booting like 2 minutes and messages poped up, telling me it&rsquo;s because of the network manager.</p>
<p>So far Arch seems stable, far faster(you cannot imagine), boots in 30 seconds with all services up. It just feels right.</p>
