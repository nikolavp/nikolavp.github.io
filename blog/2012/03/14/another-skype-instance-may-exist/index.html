After many attempts to get rid of the message by restarting skype, I finally googled the message and found out that there are two .lck files that need to be deleted. But after trying it and restarting it again, this didn&rsquo;t solve it. If you happen to be one of those unlucky &ldquo;souls&rdquo;. Do the following:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/.Skype/
find -name '*.lck' -exec rm {} +
mv ${old_profile} ${old_profile}.back
</code></pre>
<p>This deletes all .lck files and makes a backup of your login history data, assuming ${old_profile} is the name of your skype login name.</p>
<p>Now open skype, login in with your account, quit skype and then to restore the history do:</p>
<pre><code>rsync -av ${old_profile}.old/ ${old_profile}/
