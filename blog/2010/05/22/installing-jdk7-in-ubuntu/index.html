Last time i checked it was too buggy to setup so i was a bit of disappointed. As I using ubuntu on my laptop i wanted to check if my distro is providing a development package for the new vm but that wasn&rsquo;t the case :(. Luckily the jdk project provides some nice prepackaged binaries you can install yourself over <a href="http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/jdk7/binaries/index.html">here</a>. After getting the binaries for my architecture(x64) and unpacking the archive i got a jdk1.7.0 directory. In ubuntu it pretty easy to set your platform default options and the tool for this is update-alternatives. Here are the commands if you have Ubuntu:</p>
<p>Move the directory to the jvm directory where it should reside:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mv jdk1.7.0/ /usr/lib/jvm 
</code></pre>
<p>Check how many alternatives you have:</p>
<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --config java
</code></pre>
<p>Install the new alternative:</p>
<pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/jre/bin/java 2
</code></pre>
<p>where 2 should be the next unused index from the last command. So if you have 2 java alternatives your new installation should have index 3</p>
<p>Set the platform default to be the new option:</p>
<pre><code>update-alternatives --config java
</code></pre>
<p>Now all your java applications will use the new jdk. I cannot tell the difference but as I work more with eclipse and other java tools i will be make my opinions and might share them here :)</p>
<p>Happy coding</p>
