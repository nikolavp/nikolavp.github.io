Today, while I was using the KDE 4.1 I noticed that is a bit slower than it was before with 3.5. So after a little searching(one query in gogle) on the net I found [this](http://techbase.kde.org/User:Lemma/KDE4-NVIDIA) page which just saved my day. I can now say that KDE is faster than ever it was. I can't believe they managed to make the damn thing even faster :). Nice work guys, keep it up!
