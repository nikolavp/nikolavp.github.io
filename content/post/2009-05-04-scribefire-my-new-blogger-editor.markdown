      This is the first time i write from ScribeFire - my new choice for blog editor. I tried almost every client out there for Linux(since i am using kubuntu) and they were all buggy for me. For example






	
  * I didn't manage to configure [kblogger-kde4](http://kblogger.pwsp.net/) - the damn thing couldn't find my posts and entries

	
  * [Blogtk](http://kblogger.pwsp.net/) didn't even start - it wanted gtkhtml2 which python couldn't find and after I installed it I got a ValueError in a property named "name" and I was too tired to look at the code. 

	
  * Divel - which I didn't like at all :)





     I just installed ScribeFire and i didn't have a problem with it and I also like the interface it has mostly anything. It seems that the browser will really become my desktop in a year or two. I am not sure why, but the homepage is not working for ScribeFire. Fortunately i managed to configure the plugin and it is working really nice. The interface is pretty slick and the I can see the KISS principle everywhere :).
