Hmm today I noticed that we at home have too many books. For example I want to read a novel and I am not sure if we have that or not and where it stays on those shelves and in bookcases. Enter [books.google.com](http://books.google.com) with My Library support. Now i only need to organize those a little :). Another nice open software for that is [Tellico](http://periapsis.org/tellico/) (yes I use KDE). I will have to choose one of them for the job.
