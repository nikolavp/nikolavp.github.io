Today while i was looking at kdevelop4 to see the new stuff i clicked
<Ctrl><F12> accidentally and plasma showed up in front of me. I am using this shortcut more and more and it is really a huge fun. For example to see what's the time or notes on the Desktop. The new folder view also :). The little things made the difference once more :)
