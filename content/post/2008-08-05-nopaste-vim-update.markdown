Today i posted an improved version of nopaste in the scripts database at vim.org You can find the script [here](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2328). It will help you paste code/text in rafb.net/paste to use it on IRC or some other chat programs. For me it was really useful so i made it public.
