It's pretty late here. I just entered my room, because I was at the OpenFest today and after that I met some friends. Look forward to read about the OpenFest tomorrow, because I am too tired to write the whole story and I actually don't have the time. Tomorrow there are lectures in FMI and Diskrete Math is too important to be missed.
