Maybe you've heard about the Aurora project from mozilla labs, well I wasn't and I was impressed from the videos over [here](http://www.jroller.com/desmax/entry/mozilla_aurora). It seems that maybe the Web will outperform the Desktop some day. I hope that it doesn't happen so soon, because I really like the Desktop more and most of the applications I use today are Desktop based(mostly Qt/KDE).
