Hmm today i finally found a nice TreeExplorer for vim. I was looking for something like this for so long.




	
    * It had to be plugable to the UI and not clutter it





	
  * It had to **list** the files in a directories of my project






	
  * I wanted to be able to open the files from there to the right side of the window as antoher buffer/tab






There are many plugins out there that solve some of the problems/requirements in the list, but they were not complete. I have tried project(this one was good), the built in explorer, some other explorers, which names i cannot remember :D.

Enter [NERDTree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658). That is one of the plugins that saves your day. I just put

    
    map <F6> :NERDTreeToggle


in my vimrc and now when i hit F6 i have a list of the files in my home directory. I go to that window with either the mouse or <C-W> w and now i can use the neat features of the plugin.

    
    ? - get helpC - make the directory your ROOTo - open/close the directory(this shows the files also in the     directory as a list


When you finish don't forget to hit F6 again :D
